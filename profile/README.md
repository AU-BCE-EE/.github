# Environmental Engineering Section

# Getting access

# Guidance for AU-BCE-EE members
There are multiple repos that provide guidance for AU-BCE-EE members (and, in the case of some public repos, anyone else who is interested). These repos all start with "guidance-" and can be found here, after signing into your GitHub account: <https://github.com/orgs/AU-BCE-EE/repositories?q=guidance->. These two are complete or well-developed anyway:

* [guidance-GitHub](https://github.com/AU-BCE-EE/guidance-GitHub) on using Git and GitHub
* [guidance-data-analysis](https://github.com/AU-BCE-EE/guidance-data-analysis) on data analysis

This one is for guidance that does not fit into the other repos:
* [guidance](https://github.com/AU-BCE-EE/guidance)

Other guidance repos have been started but are not complete.
